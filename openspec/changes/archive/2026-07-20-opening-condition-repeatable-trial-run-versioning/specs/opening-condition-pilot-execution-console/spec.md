## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Current trial run tracking
The opening-condition execution console SHALL keep operator actions scoped to the currently selected or newly bootstrapped pilot run.

#### Scenario: Refresh follows current run id
- **WHEN** the portal has a current backend pilot task
- **THEN** the refresh action reloads that task id and its readiness instead of always using the workspace base task id

#### Scenario: Workspace switch resets current run
- **WHEN** the operator switches to another opening-condition workspace
- **THEN** the portal clears the current run and returns to that workspace base task lookup

#### Scenario: Real upload reports new run id
- **WHEN** real-file bootstrap creates a new run-specific task
- **THEN** the material-intake page displays the returned task id and state as the active pilot run
